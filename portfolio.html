                 		<li><img src="/portfolio/shirt.jpg"/><p>during highschool from junior untill senior year I was president of the anime club. As such one of my yearly duties was to design a shirt for the club. These shirts had to contain the hand drawn self portrait of each club member. </p></li>

                 		<img src="/portfolio/canyon1.jpg" /><p>safter hiking through the zion National park, I turned around to take a picture of this tall lonley rock. I love this picture and to this day is one of my favorites. This is because of the beauty in which it represents. A lonley and clouded dark sky filled flat land scape is over shadowed by this massive hulking spire. </p></li>

                 		<img src="/portfolio/thewaiter.jpg" /><p>This was my first photoshop project in school. The assignment was to create a movie poster for a movie and genre you came up with. I of course chose comedy/action as they are my two favorite. This movie was called the Waiter, an action comedy movie about a man who works as waiter by day and secret agent by night.  </p></li>

                 		<p>I am into this game called Magic the Gathering. I play at this store called voltage gaming. the owner is a nice guy who loves to flaunt his starbucks and chipotle addictions. I made a token card of him using photoshop. I took an image of him and created a stary background for him to blend into. I then found a helmet image and created hallowed eye holes by turning it into a png. Then I applied the helmet layer to his face. After this I created a starbucks drink and sword in his hands as well as a chipotle halo around his head.</p></li>

</video><p> this is my 2.5d animation of the angel Avacyn from Magic the Gathering. I was inspired for this project by the "MTG" crew because of the many variances within their own 2.5d animations. The use of the angel in front of a light source, i thought, would look spectacular.</p></li>
